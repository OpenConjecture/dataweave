```

## Initial Setup

1. **Create the project directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir dataweave
   cd dataweave
   ```

2. **Initialize git (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Create the files from the artifacts above:**
   - Create `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`
   - Create `src/` directory and add `cli.ts`

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev info
   # or after building:
   node dist/cli.js info
   ```

## Publishing to npm

### First-time setup:

1. **Create an npm account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/signup
   - Verify your email

2. **Login to npm:**
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

3. **Update package.json:**
   - Replace `"yourusername"` with your GitHub username
   - Replace `"Your Name <your.email@example.com>"` with your details
   - Consider updating the homepage/repository URLs

4. **Create a LICENSE file:**
   ```bash
   echo "MIT License

   ```

### Publishing:

1. **Check if the name is available:**
   ```bash
   npm view dataweave
   ```
   If it returns "404 Not Found", the name is available!

2. **Do a dry run first:**
   ```bash
   npm publish --dry-run
   ```

3. **Publish the package:**
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

4. **Verify the publication:**
   - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/dataweave
   - Try installing it: `npm install -g dataweave`

## Important Notes

### Version Management:
- Start with `0.0.1` for the placeholder
- Use semantic versioning: `major.minor.patch`
- Update version before each publish: `npm version patch`

### npm Namespace:
- Once published, you have 24 hours to unpublish without restrictions
- After 24 hours, the name is permanently claimed (with some exceptions)
- You can continue updating the package with new versions

### Security:
- Enable 2FA on your npm account
- Consider using `npm publish --access=public` explicitly
- Use `.npmignore` to exclude development files

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Build and test locally
npm run build && npm run dev info

# Publish a new version
npm version patch
npm publish

# View package info
npm info dataweave
```

## Next Steps

After claiming the namespace:

1. Set up GitHub repository
2. Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Create a development branch
4. Start implementing real functionality
5. Update README with actual features as they're built
6. Consider creating a documentation site

## Troubleshooting

If `dataweave` is already taken, consider alternatives:
- `@yourscope/dataweave` (scoped package)
- `dataweave-cli`
- `dweave`
- `data-weave-cli`

To check availability:
```bash
npm view [package-name]
```

Good luck with your data pipeline CLI! ðŸš€
